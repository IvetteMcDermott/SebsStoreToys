# **About**
<br>
This project had been designed to be a B2C e-commerce store. The products offered are video games and toys related to them mostly. It also has a section for news about video games, events and movies related to them, in general useful information for those who enjoy video games. This had been included in thinking of expanding the experience of the user in the app, seeing us not just as an e-commerce but also a site to visit to find extras about their interests and so we can engage loyalty in the clients. These news should be constantly updating and so inform our clients of new things up through the marketing strategy.<br>

# **Bussines Model**
<br>
The project had been based in Business to Consumer (B2C) style. Being an e-commerce where wares can be found for all the ages and interests. The slogan is not a typo but a word play, since the "toys/wares" would come from the store. <br>
<br>

## **Marketing Strategy**
<br>

### **SEO**
Several SEO techniques were undertaken in order to ensure the site ranks highly in search engine results. Also the files robots.txt and sitemap.xml had been included. The sitemap.xml file had been created using 

[xml-sitemap](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/)

**Keywords:**
<br>
Starting with a brain storm of keywords that are relevant to the e-commerce itself. And reduced by making use of a word search so as to target the more relevant, the site I had used is 

[wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/)


**External Links:**
<br>
In the news section, each card/new contains a source link that would direct the user/client to the source from where was taken the information so that they can find more about it.


**Content marketing:**
<br>
The information and description of the wares in the site and other sections had been kept the more relevant to the site purpose. Also the keywords had been taken into account when creating things like categories and such, so insure they are present without getting to be considere as spam. 
Each page has its own title, and finally meta tag description had been included in the base so that every page contains them.


**Social Media Marketing: Facebook**
<br>
The e-commerce has its own facebook, the one that will keep posting a minimun of three times a week, and releasing alerts of monthly offers and benefits, which are sent by e-mail to the subscribers. This is for to motivate the subscription to our newsletter and increase the clients database.

<br>

**Email Marketing**
This will be based in our newsletter service and also to the users that had purchased with us previously. The starting strategy is to produce a monthly mail with new arrivals and deals, also will contain some news about the gaming world, etc.
Subscribed users will recieve a welcome mail informing benefits will that be coming in future mails. This refering to the monthly mail with deals, so the user does not feel overwhelmed or spammed. 
For now there is a basic mail, but in future a better design will be implemented. Also had been set for the staff to recieve a daily report from mailchimp so to keep track of the traffic on it.

Also when the user registers for an account in the app will recieve a welcome email with some information about benefits and promoting our newsletter on it.

# **Features**
<br>
The list and screenshot about them can be found   

[here](readme_docs/md_files/features.md)

<br>

## **Features to Implement in Future**
<br>
As  the time frame was affected by external factors out of my control, some of the 'could have' features had been left for future implementation.
Howsoever fields and some of the need elements for them had been set in place since the beginning, and are there for when can be done.
Some of them are:

- New arrivals: There is a field in wares model to mark them and with a filter displaying, it is planned to use a blue ribbon in the front end as distintive feature.

- Clearance: As previous one, there is a field in wares model to mark them and with a filter displaying, it is planned to use a ribbon in
             the front end as distintive feature with a different colour than the New Arrivals, at the moment the idea is yellow.

- Bookmarks: There is a charfield left in place, this is to implement a 'note' for the bookmark. As user find that bookmarks are very 
             valuable but sometimes you just cant remember what or why did you keep it, so if user/client can from their profile/bookmarks write a note so can remember if was for some ocassion or person, I think that will add value to their user experience.

- Bookmarks to Store List: Bring the bookmark feature to the list view, to show to the user if the ware is already bookmarked by them or not.

- Pages: Q&A, and Terms and Conditions had been provide for the moment with a under construction message.

- Profiles: The idea of increasing the fields, with a profile section where the user can choose some of their prefered video games so that store can include these wares in the stock. And also create a promotion section where can be displayed user's interest related items using the preference inputs.

<br>

## **Code**
<br>

For this project, as for previous ones, I have seen and read many tutorials from where I had tried to get some understading of the logic more than copy the code itself, but still could not avoid in certain cases taken code and adapt it to the project and its necessities.

The shopping cart and checkout apps had been taken from Boutique Ado with some twists to fit better the project.

Stack Overflow is one of the mains for finding answers to specific questions 
https://stackoverflow.com

The newsletter functionality had been set with mailchimp, and had made use of the following blog for set it. 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-newsletter-app-using-mailchimp-and-django/

The functionality for reply the reviews had been taken from, being the simplest one found 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71396075/i-want-to-make-reply-to-comments-feature-in-django

On CSS, there had been couple of animations used in the project, with minor changes, as follows
