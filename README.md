[xml-sitemap](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/)

**Keywords:**
<br>
Starting with a brain storms of keywords that are relevant to the e-commerce itself. And reduced by making use of a word search so target the more relevant, the site I had used is:

[wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/)


**External Links:**
<br>
In the news section, each card/new contains a source link that would direct the user/client to source from where was taken the information so that they can find more about.

<br>
For the wares offered will contain relevant information about the product and in the news section will be posted any new as new release, movie or event related to.

The e-commerce has its own facebook, the one that will keep posting a minimun of three times a week, and releasing alerts of month offers and benefits, which are send by e-mail to the subscribers. This is for motivate the subscription to our newsletter and increase the clients database.


**Email Marketing**
This will be based in our newsletter service and also to the users that had purchased with us previously. The starting strategy is to produce a monthly mail with news arrivals and some news about the gaming world, etc.  Planning monthly so the user dont feel overwhelmed with.

# **Features**

The list and screenshot about them can be found here.

## **Features to Implement in Future**
<br>
As  the time frame was affected by external factors out of my control, some of the 'could have' features had been left for future implementation.
Howsoever fields and some of the need elements for them had been set in place since begin, and are there for when can be done.
Some of them are:

- New arrivals: There is a field in wares model to mark them and with a filter displaying, it is planned to use a blue ribbon in the front end
                as distintive feature.

- Clearance: As previous one, there is a field in wares model to mark them and with a filter displaying, it is planned to use a ribbon in
             the front end as distintive feature with a different colour than the New Arrivals, at the moment the idea is yellow.

- Bookmarks: There is a char field left in place, this is to implement a 'note' for the bookmark. As use find that bookmarks are very 
             valuables but sometimes you just cant remember what or why you did keep it, so if user/client can from their profile/bookmarks write a note so can remember if was for some ocassion or person, I think that will add value to they user experience.
- Pages: Q&A, and Terms and Conditions had been provide for the moment with a under construction message.
