# **Bussines Model**
<br>
The project had been based in Business to Consumer (B2C) style. Being an e-commerce where wares for all the ages and interests. The slogan is a word game, since the "toys/wares" would come from the store. <br>
<br>

## **Marketing Strategy**
<br>

### **SEO**
Several SEO techniques were undertaken in order to ensure the site ranks highly in search engine results. Also the files robots.txt and sitemap.xml had been included. The sitemap.xml file had been created using [xml-sitemap](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/)

**Keywords:**
<br>
Starting with a brain storms of keywords that are relevant to the e-commerce itself. And reduced by making use of a word search so target the more relevant, the site I had used is 

[wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/)


**External Links:**
<br>
In the news section, each card/new contains a source link that would direct the user/client to source from where was taken the information so that they can find more about.


**Content marketing:**
<br>
The information and description of the wares in the site and other sections had been keep the more relevant to the site purpose. Also the keywords had been take in count when creating things like categories and such, so insure they are present without get to be spam. 
Each page has its own title, and finally meta tag description had been include in the base so that every page contains them.


**Social Media Marketing: Facebook**
<br>
The e-commerce has its own facebook, the one that will keep posting a minimun of three times a week, and releasing alerts of month offers and benefits, which are send by e-mail to the subscribers. This is for motivate the subscription to our newsletter and increase the clients database.

<br>

**Email Marketing**
This will be based in our newsletter service and also to the users that had purchased with us previously. The starting strategy is to produce a monthly mail with news arrivals and deals, also will contain some news about the gaming world, etc.
The user will recieve a welcome mail informing benefits will be coming in next mails. This refering to the monthly mail with deals, so the user dont feel overwhelmed with. 
For now there is a basic mail, but in future a better design will be implemented. Also had been set to recieve a report daily from mailchimp so that can be keep track of the traffic on it.

# **Features**
<br>
The list and screenshot about them can be found   

[here](readme_docs/md_files/features.md)

<br>

## **Features to Implement in Future**
<br>
As  the time frame was affected by external factors out of my control, some of the 'could have' features had been left for future implementation.
Howsoever fields and some of the need elements for them had been set in place since begin, and are there for when can be done.
Some of them are:

- New arrivals: There is a field in wares model to mark them and with a filter displaying, it is planned to use a blue ribbon in the front end as distintive feature.

- Clearance: As previous one, there is a field in wares model to mark them and with a filter displaying, it is planned to use a ribbon in
             the front end as distintive feature with a different colour than the New Arrivals, at the moment the idea is yellow.

- Bookmarks: There is a char field left in place, this is to implement a 'note' for the bookmark. As use find that bookmarks are very 
             valuables but sometimes you just cant remember what or why you did keep it, so if user/client can from their profile/bookmarks write a note so can remember if was for some ocassion or person, I think that will add value to they user experience.

- Bookmarks to Store List: Bring the bookmark feature to the list view, to show to the user if the ware is already bookmarked by them or not.

- Pages: Q&A, and Terms and Conditions had been provide for the moment with a under construction message.

- Profiles: The idea of increase the fields, with a profile section where the user can choose some of their prefer video games so   that store can include these wares in the stock. And also create a promotion section where can be display user's interests related items using the preference inputs.
